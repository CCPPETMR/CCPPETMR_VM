This is a virtual machine with pre-installed versions of the CCP PETMR
software SIRF and associated utilities.

To get all software up-to-date, type

   update_VM.sh.

To run Gadgetron interface demos, first open a new terminal and type gadgetron. 

Then open another terminal, change to ~/devel/SIRF/examples and check the
readme.txt.

Note that by default, STIR will not be fully installed, but only its
necessary components for SIRF. If you want to use the STIR executables and/or
its own Python interface, type

    update_VM_to_full_STIR.sh

This will also create a new folder ~/STIR-exercises with some example STIR files.

Note that you have to do this only once. Future calls to update_VM.sh
will also update STIR completely.
