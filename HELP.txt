To make interfaces to Gadgetron and STIR forks on CCPPETMR up-to-date, 
type update_VM.sh.

To run Gadgetron interface demos, first open a new terminal and type gadgetron. 
Then open another terminal, change to ~/devel/xGadgetron/examples 
and type python demo1.py etc. Type demo1.py -h to get a brief description of 
demo1.py and its usage.

To run STIR Python interface demos, change to ~/devel/xSTIR/examples and type 
python stir_demo1.py etc.

---------------------------------------------
Updating Gadgetron, STIR and their interfaces
---------------------------------------------

If you want to stay abreast with the latest developments in Gadgetron, STIR
and interfaces, then instead of running update_VM.sh you can do a more thorough 
update by performing the following steps.

Change to ~/devel/CCPPETMR_VM and type git pull.

Change to folder 'scripts' and type ./ADD_REMOTE.sh. This only needs to be 
done ONCE.

Whenever you want to update your VM:

- Type export TMP=<password you used to log in>.

- Type ./UPDATE_ALL.sh.

- When the above script finished (it may take about 1 hour), you may like to 
  erase the value of TMP by typing export TMP= or simply close the terminal.

Please be aware that it may not always be possible to keep interfaces
synchronized with Gadgetron and STIR, and it is therefore a good idea
to backup your VM e.g. by exporting it before the full update.

Installing ismrmrd-python-tools
-------------------------------

Change to ~/devel/CCPPETMR_VM and type git pull.

Change to folder 'scripts' and type ./INSTALL_ISMRMRD_PYTHON_TOOLS.sh. 

----------------
Installing SciPy
----------------

To run ismrmrd-python-tools scripts you need to have scipy installed on your VM,
which is done by the following command:

sudo apt-get install python-scipy
