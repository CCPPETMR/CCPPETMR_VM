This is a virtual machine with pre-installed versions of the CCP PETMR
software SIRF and associated utilities.

Check https://github.com/CCPPETMR/CCPPETMR_VM/wiki for more information.

To get all software up-to-date, type

   update_VM.sh

To run MR demos, first open a new terminal and type

    gadgetron

Then open another terminal, change to ~/devel/SIRF/examples for both
Python and MATLAB examples (some info is in the README.txt). However,
MATLAB is not installed on this VM of course.


Note that by default, STIR will not be fully installed, but only its
necessary components for SIRF. If you want to use the STIR executables and/or
its own Python interface, type

    update_VM_to_full_STIR.sh

This will also create a new folder ~/devel/STIR-exercises with some
example STIR files.
Note that you have to do this only once. Future calls to update_VM.sh
will also update STIR completely.
